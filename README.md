These formulae provide software tailored to scientific endeavors. Need to store
large amounts of data in a sparse matrix, solve a huge optimization problem or
process the images from your space telescope? Maybe we can help!

How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap homebrew/science` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/science/<formula>`.
